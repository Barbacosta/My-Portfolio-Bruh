            <p>Hello. I don't know what information to use and I don't want to take up too much of my time. So let's quickly go through it all.</p>
            <p>I was born on August 2nd, 1999 around 8 p.m. Unfortunately, it was a Monday. This means I am a Leo sun or rising (I don't know) and some other stuff.</p>
            <p>So that's enough about my birth. Let's get into the juicy stuff.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="childhood , story">
            <h3>PART 1</h3>
            <p>I grew up the youngest of three brothers; raised by a single parent: my father; primarily in a studio apartment.
            It certainly wasn't spacious, but it worked out the best it could. I was (and still am) a rather smart person, but due to many factors,
            I ended up misbehaving in class and being a class clown. I definitely did not learn many hard skills, or soft skills for that matter.
            As I got into middle school, the teenage angst got to me. I began having a very negative outlook on life, people, and the world in general.
            </p>
            <p>I continued having beliefs that really messed up my mental health. At this point I was old enough to understand concepts of the human experience;
            I did not have the guidance needed to even begin to conceptualize this, but the societal expectations of being a man are what subconsciously guided me.
            Of course I would be mad at the world. Oddly enough though, despite my mother abandoning our family, I could never bring myself to hate women.
            This does NOT mean I respected women. They way men are socialized, we are taught that women should be degraded and thus, inferior. Took a while to realize that.
            High School was another issue altogether. Instead of struggling through insecurities, I finally embraced surpression of my emotions. Like a "real man."
            </p>
            <p>As I grew through my teenage years, my insecurities got stronger and new ones emerged. I continued to slack off in class and my grades, attendance, and record reflected that.
            Life at home was actually more difficult to deal with because I felt so isolated from my family and no one ever bothered to connect with me or guide me.
            So, due to the emotional whole in my heart, I continued through life without a care and, more importantly, a plan. At 16 I got my first job and that essentially became my identity outside of school.
            Except for Sundays, if I wasn't at school, I was at work. I didn't have a plan or any interest in making a plan, so I just continued to work.
            That is the right thing to do, right?

            <h3>PART 2</h3>
            <p>I moved on from my first job to the next, and the next, and the next.I eventually decided to just stick to the whole cooking thing. It was fun enough and a practical skill
                and I found myself working in a steakhouse inside the Rivers Casino.
                and I thought it was really great progress in my career. The benefits, amenities, pay (it was the most I had been paid up to that point) were like shiny new toys
                on Christmas morning. I stuck around for a few years, slowly ruining my mental health. I was falling into a cycle of work, sleep, work with some unhealthy habits in between.
                Fortunately, with the help of some "influences," I did eventually realize what was happening to me. I knew I wanted a change, but after 20 years of life without a plan,
                I didn't know how or where to start. Just before the COVID-19 outbreak, the man who I thought was my best friend at the time left the country to live with his family. I was alone.
            </p>
            <p>When COVID-19 came to the U.S. and disrupted almost every industry, the casino closed too. I thought this gave me an opportunity to get a break from everything I was feeling. I was wrong.
                Turns out it only made me understand even more what I felt. I finally understood why I entered an industry that I didn't really care about: I was just trying to appease to my family.
                It was unfortunate to know I wasted my life for someone else, but where else could I go? The casino opened up again, and I went back to work. After asking management what the safety protocols would be for COVID,
                I understood that our safety was not a priority. At that point in my life there was a lot I would put up with, but health and safety was not one of them. I quit. I felt free, like the sun was just a little brighter.
                Still, without a plan I was just kinda vibing.
            </p>
            <p>I took the rest of the week off as a sort vacation and starting Monday, I would start my job search. My mind was set to get away from the food industry, but it was the only experience I've ever had,
                so where could I go? After a week or two I found a job listing for a "Culinary Assistant" which was described as working with food preparation and some administrative work.
                It was the perfect middle ground for what I was looking for: office job (or at least adjacent), my experience met the requirements, local, better pay.
